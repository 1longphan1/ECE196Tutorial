## Preamble

You may have heard the term "full stack" before. Web developers have coined it as meaning all the systems from the database (backend) to the user interface (frontend).

But web developers don't get all the fun. As Electrical Engineers, we have our *own* definition of "full stack".

For us, the full stack is:

1. Hardware
1. Firmware
1. Communication
1. User Interface

You're half way there! In one fell swoop, we're going to finish off the last two.

## Assignment

In this assignment you will become a full stack engineer by learning to create a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (GUI) and a communication
system to interact with a microcontroller.

You will create a **client** (the GUI running on your computer/phone) which communicates with a **peripheral** (your microcontroller) over some medium.

**You are once again faced with an important decision**

You now have **four** pathways to choose from:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="python" title="USB: Python & Arduino" >}}
  {{< card link="python" title="USB: Python & Rust" >}}
  {{< card link="python" title="BLE: Swift & Arduino" >}}
  {{< card link="python" title="BLE: Swift & Rust" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
  You **must** have a Mac and an iPhone to develop Swift apps.
{{< /callout >}}

Similarly to the previous assignment, some of these paths are easier than others, but less interesting.
