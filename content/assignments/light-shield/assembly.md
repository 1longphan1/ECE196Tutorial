## Step-by-step

{{% steps %}}

### Components

First, grab the components you need from the component table.

You need:

- 11 LEDs (with colors of your choice)
- 11 560-1k resistors (to select brightness of your choice)
- Pin headers
- 1 Microphone and accompanying module

### Soldering

Then, grab a solder paste syringe, you may need to share with your peers.

Then, go to EnVision to solder the components with the available equipment of your choice (probably a soldering iron).

## Things to Consider

- Which direction should the LEDs point?
- Which side should the pin headers and microphone be placed?
