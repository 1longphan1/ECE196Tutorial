In this assignment you will learn to create a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (GUI) to interact with a microcontroller.

We will be migrating from CircuitPython to the Arduino C ecosystem.

Download the Arduino software [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

If you are unfamiliar with Arduino, the official [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) contains great resources for learning about embedded development. You may also want to take a look at the [reference page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) for help with Arduino's syntax and language.
